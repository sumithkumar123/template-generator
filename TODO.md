# TODO for Backend Redeployment and Testing

- [ ] Commit and push the updated `backend/render.yaml` and any backend code changes to your Git repository.
- [ ] Trigger a redeploy on Render via the Render dashboard or by pushing to the connected branch.
- [ ] Monitor the Render build and deploy logs for success or errors.
- [ ] Verify the backend deployment by:
  - Accessing the backend URL (e.g., https://template-generator-backend.onrender.com) in a browser or using curl.
  - Confirming the API root endpoint returns the expected response.
- [ ] Test the full application flow with the deployed backend URL:
  - Run the frontend locally configured to use the deployed backend URL.
  - Upload PDF/DOCX files.
  - Generate reports with template sections.
  - Export documents to PDF, Word, PowerPoint.
  - Use clarifying questions feature.
  - Delete uploaded files.
  - Confirm no CORS or other errors occur.
- [ ] Report any issues or errors for further fixes.
