## ok done, now proceed to write overall code , first folder structure and then what code needs to written in what file, finally how to run to get expected outcome according to pdf

Of course. Let's build the **AI-Powered Template Generation Engine**.

Here is the complete guide, including the folder structure, the code for each file, and instructions on how to run the application to get the expected outcome.

### **Overall Architecture**

We will build a full-stack application with a Python backend and a React frontend.

  * **Backend**: A FastAPI server will handle file uploads, parse the documents, and communicate with an AI model (like OpenAI's GPT) to generate the content.
  * **Frontend**: A React application will provide the user interface, featuring the split-view layout described in the Web 4.0 document: a chat on the left for conversational commands and a preview panel on the right that updates in real-time.

### **1. Project Folder Structure**

Create a main project folder (e.g., `template_generator`) and structure it as follows. This separation keeps the backend and frontend code clean and independent.

```
template_generator/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── main.py         # Main FastAPI application file
│   │   ├── api.py          # API routes for upload and generation
│   │   ├── services.py     # Business logic (parsing, AI calls)
│   │   └── models.py       # Pydantic models for request/response
│   ├── requirements.txt    # Backend Python dependencies
│   └── uploads/            # Temporary folder for uploaded files
│
└── frontend/
    ├── public/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   │   ├── ChatPanel.jsx
    │   │   └── PreviewPanel.jsx
    │   ├── App.jsx           # Main React component
    │   └── index.css         # Basic styling
    ├── package.json
    └── vite.config.js
```

### **2. Backend Code**

Here is the code for each file in the `backend/` directory.

I'll start with the Python backend files, including the main application setup, API routes, and the services for document parsing and AI interaction.

### **3. Frontend Code**

Now, here is the code for the `frontend/` directory, which creates the interactive user interface.

### **4. How to Run the Application**

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

#### **Step 1: Set Up and Run the Backend**

1.  **Navigate to the `backend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd template_generator/backend

    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
3.  **Set Your OpenAI API Key:**
      * **IMPORTANT**: You must have an API key from OpenAI.
      * Set it as an environment variable so the Python code can access it.
    <!-- end list -->
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"

    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
        The backend server will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

    ```

#### **Step 2: Set Up and Run the Frontend**

1.  **Open a new terminal window.**

2.  **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd template_generator/frontend

    ```

3.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

4.  **Run the React Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
        The frontend will now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

    ```

#### **Step 3: Use the Application**

1.  **Open your web browser** and go to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  **Upload Source Files**: Use the upload area to select one or more PDF or DOCX files.
3.  **Define Your Template**: Use the chat input to add or remove sections from the report template.
4.  **Generate**: Click the "Generate Document" button.
5.  **View the Output**: The frontend will communicate with the backend, which will then call the OpenAI API. The final, evidence-backed document will appear in the preview panel on the right.
